# Better World - A Blockchain Based Social Welfare and CrowdFunding platform

Welcome to the Better World NFT Marketplace, a revolutionary platform that empowers you to make a positive impact on the world while indulging in the exciting world of digital art and collectibles. Our mission is to combine the innovative potential of blockchain technology with the power of social impact. Join us as we strive to create a Better World, one NFT at a time.

## Problem Statement
The existing system faces challenges related to:

- **Accountability**: Charitable firms often lack transparency, making it challenging for donors to know where their contributions are being used effectively.

- **Lack of Transparency**: Donors are often in the dark regarding the utilization of their funds, leaving them unsure about the impact of their generosity.

- **Humanitarian Crises**: Ongoing wars and conflicts exacerbate the need for support in affected regions, demanding a more efficient and effective donation platform.


## Proposed Solution
Our solution incorporates the following features to address these issues:

- **Blockchain Technology** for Donations: We use the XDC blockchain for transparent and secure financial transactions, ensuring donors can track their contributions in real-time.

- **NFT Certificates**: To enhance transparency and provide donors with a sense of prestige, users are required to purchase NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) to make donations. These NFTs act as certificates, confirming their contribution. This unique approach not only provides a tangible proof of donation but also motivates other users to contribute by adding a prestige element.

- **Donation of Used Items**: People who prefer not to donate money can contribute by donating used items like old clothes, which will be distributed to those in need.

- **Volunteer Opportunities**: For individuals who want to contribute their time and skills, we provide options to become a volunteer and directly participate in social welfare initiatives.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: We offer an intuitive interface with real-time updates on supported projects, including progress reports, photos, and videos.

- **Educational Content**: Information on ongoing wars and conflicts is provided, explaining the humanitarian crises and the urgent need for donations.

- **Third-Party Auditing**: Independent auditors and NGOs review and publish audit reports for the financial and operational transparency of organizations.

- **Feedback Loop**: A direct feedback system lets beneficiaries share their experiences and needs, fostering transparency and connection.

- **Social Issue Events**: We also host events on various social issues, such as blood donation drives and beach cleanups, encouraging community involvement and social impact.

- **Mini Region wise Issue Centric Social Media Platform**: Our platform includes a mini social media platform designed for government officials and residents of India. This feature allows users to report issues directly to governmental organizations and designated individuals. Issues are categorized and shared only with relevant authorities in specific geographical areas, ensuring efficient resolution.
